GRIPPER SELECTION FOR ROBOTIC ARM USING HUMAN HAND GRASPING TAXONOMY.
The selection of best gripper for pick and place robotic arm is always a tedious task to choose from various grippers available now a days. This paper deals with a performance comparison of parallel and 3 finger gripper based on parameters like grasping force and contact points between gripper and objects having different shapes and size. Simulation experiments are conducted by gazebo simulator on grippers, to pick and place 10 anonymous objects. Based on human hand grasping taxonomy simulation experiments are sub-divided into 3 categories such as normal, misaligned and rotation grasping. Depending upon degree of easiness in grasping objects, points are awarded to grippers. If gripper easily picks up object, 1 point is awarded and if it finds difficulty in grasping,0 is awarded.
